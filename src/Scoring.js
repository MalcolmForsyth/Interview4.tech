Q: What are your thoughts on object-oriented programming?
A: I think object-oriented programming is a very effective way to structure code. It makes it easier to read and maintain the code.
The response provides a too short overview of why object-oriented programming is effective, but the candidate could have discussed more specific examples of how it works in practice. 

Q: Tell us about a time something went wrong in a project you were managing.
A: While I worked at Amazon last summer as a project manager, there was an intern who could never meet the deadlines and it was about to impact our final project. We resolved the error by moving the intern to another project that interested them more and bringing in some additional help to meet the deadline. Clearly, our team wasn't working for the intern, so we had to adjust and fill in their responsibilities with a more passionate worker. Additionally, the intern was able to find a project they enjoyed and were passionate about working harder on.
This response is great. It shows how the candidate worked to find the best situation for all parties involved. They clearly discussed the situation, their solution, and why their solution was beneficial. 

Q: Tell me about a time when you had to troubleshoot and debug a complex issue.
A: One time, I had to debug an issue that was caused by a race condition in the code. The bug was difficult to reproduce because it only happened sporadically. I spent a lot of time reading through the code and trying to understand how it worked. Only by first taking the time to understand the code, I was able to track down the root cause of the problem and fix it. The problem was caused by two threads that were accessing the same data without synchronizing their access properly.

The response provides a brief but accurate overview of the advantages of object-oriented programming.

Q: What was your most successful project? 
A: My most successful project I created over my last two years working for the Genomic Biology Lab. We used the HuggingFace NLP library to pretrain models on protein sequences as text, and then fine-tune the models on different specific tasks, such as protein family prediction or protein-protein interaction prediction. This allowed us to analyze how the features of the model inferred large-scale biological trends in proteins.
This is a great response. They discuss the specifics of their project which displays their technical prowess. They discuss the impact of the project. The response is well-worded.

Q: What is overfitting? How can you prevent it?
A: Overfitting is when the data resembles a specific function, and the neural net finds that function instead of learning from the data.
This response does not show a thorough understanding of overfitting and does not discuss how to prevent it at all.

Q: How do you prioritize and manage tasks?
A: There is no one-size-fits-all approach to prioritizing and managing tasks, as everyone may have their own method that is different from others. Instead, you need to be mindful of the overall impact of your tasks on the team's success and make decisions based on the most important things to the team.
The response offers a good overview of how to prioritize and manage tasks, but the candidate could have discussed more specifics on their approaches and what they deem as important.

Q: What are the most important qualities for a software engineer?
A: The most important qualities for a software engineer are dedication, dedication to their work, and the ability to work effectively with other people. 
The response is too short. While these may be important qualities for a software engineer, they could have provided more details on what they find important.

Q: Which is your most significant accomplishment?
A: I think my most significant accomplishment would be my work on the software development team that created the software that was used in the Olympic games.
The response is too short and does not go into detail about their contributions to the software.

Q: How do you handle difficult challenges?
A: Personally, I like to take on challenges head-on. When I am feeling overwhelmed, I like to sit down and make a list of what needs to be done. Once I have a plan, it is much easier for me to focus and work through the challenge. Additionally, if there are parts of the challenge that I am not sure how to approach, I will reach out to my team or other resources for help.
The response offers a detailed overview of how the candidate handles difficult challenges by making a plan and reaching out for help when needed. The response is well written and provides good insights into how the candidate approaches difficult situations.

Q: Tell us about a time something went wrong in a project you were managing.
A: One time the person I was managing didn't do the task that I asked, and I had to figure out how to make them do that task that I asked. It ended up fine.
The response is too short and does not provide enough detail about the situation. Additionally, the candidate's response is very informal and poorly worded.

Q: How would you handle a situation where another team member is not following your instructions?
A: I would try to find out what the issue was and how I could help fix it. If that didn't work, then I might need to bring in someone else to help solve the problem.
The response provides okay steps for solving a difficult situation with other team members, as well as if needed bringing in outside resources. The response is short and the candidate could have gone into more detail about how they may deal with potential issues.

Q: What was your most successful project? Why was it successful?
A: My most successful project was probably the app I built last summer. It used NLP to interview students. Maybe it was the one I built the summer before that since I used huge datasets and agglomerative clustering in a time series pattern. I enjoy my school projects though.
This is a bad response. The candidate does not have a decisive answer and should have spent more time thinking about their response. Additionally, it is lacking in detail. 

Q: How would you create an environment of collaboration on your team?
A:  I would spend a while explaining why we should be collaborative, and then I would punish those who disobeyed me for their impotence.
This is an awful response. This candidate shows a poor understanding of what is needed from a Project Manager to make a collaborative team and wrongly believes that punishment could lead to a collaborative environment.

Q: How would you create an environment of collaboration on your team?
A: I would make sure to acknowledge contributions from members when they are successful in their efforts. However, the most effective method to encourage collaboration that I would employ is in the absence of punishment in the case of mistakes. Mistakes are how developers learn, and punishment stifles innovation. People on my team will want to try new things for the sake of seeing how they will turn out
This is a good response. This candidate outlines ways to encourage collaboration by building a supportive team environment.

Q: What are your experiences with agile methodology?
A: My first experience with the agile methodology was at my last internship, with Ameren. We used the Agile workflow to separate our various assignments into small, feasible chunks, as well as to track long-term goals to hold us accountable to project deliverables.

This is a great response. The candidate has experience with agile methodology and provides good insight into how it can be used in different settings. The response is well-written and provides insights on the use of agile methodology that may be valuable to the position.

Q: What are your thoughts on the role of testing in software engineering?
A: I think a comprehensive testing suite is an important part of any project. Ensuring code is functioning properly before it goes live is critical, and the only way to be certain code is correct is through comprehensive tests. Having tests that cover all edge cases as well as all possible input partitions not only ensures that the code is correct, but it can also make the code faster to write as it helps identify where the bugs might be. 
This is a great response. The candidate has articulated well why testing is important and provides insights into how comprehensive tests can help to find bugs early in the development process. The response is well-written and detailed.

Q: What is overfitting? How can you prevent it?
A: Overfitting is, when training some predictive model, we find that the accuracy on the training set is significantly higher than the test set. This can occur for many reasons, a popular one is a model being overparameterized. We can understand overfitting as the model learning specific, non-relevant patterns in the training data that lead to poor generalization. Some approaches to prevent it include regularization, collecting more diverse data, or reducting the model's capacity.
This is a great response. This response shows a deep understanding of the mechanism of overfitting and includes potential solutions to mitigate the problem. The answer is well-worded and thorough in its response.

Q: What are your thoughts on the role of testing in software engineering?
A: I think a few tests can be nice to ensure that code works but they aren’t strictly necessary because you can usually just figure out if it works without them.
This is a bad response. The candidate does not believe in the need for comprehensive testing and does not provide any justification for their position. Additionally, the response is unorganized and poorly written.

Q: What do you do to minimize security risks?
A: I spend time understanding the risks and how to address them, but my responses are informal. They aren't technical enough for a response that is critical of their approach. 
The response needs some improvements in terms of detail and length. Specifically, there isn’t any information on how the candidate would respond to different types of attacks from long-term vs short-term threats, for example.

Q: Tell me about your design process.
A: I use a process that is pattern-based and iterative. I document the steps in my code, make sure they are working as expected then continue to improve them over time. The response lacks detail on how their approach works or why it's effective at solving the problem at hand.
This response has some issues with structure but overall provides good insight into the candidate’s design thinking skills for software development projects.

The candidate does well to discuss their development process in more detail, including what they look for when making design decisions. However, their response is a little vague, giving a specific example of a situation where they followed this process could be a beneficial step.

Q: How do you handle difficult challenges?
A: When I am faced with a difficult challenge, I make sure to first take a step back and think about the problem from all possible angles. I try to find a solution that works well both in terms of technical complexity and business impact. An example of this is when I was working on a project last summer on the Apple Watch team. We built features to expand the functionality of the fitness tracking but found that we needed to completely rework the data pipeline. We spent a lot of time rebuilding the system to manage the sensor data from the ground up, which required us to speak to a lot of teams.
This is an exceptional response. The candidate introduces their approach at a high level before discussing the specifics of how they applied their approach to a specific difficult challenge they faces while on the Apple Watch team.

Q: Tell me about your past work experience in web development?
A: I did an internship with Cisco this past summer where I helped redesign their website that allows users to receive customer support. We found that users had a bad experience with the interface of the site, so redesigning the UI/UX was a high-priority task. We focused on making it easy for users to find the information they were looking for with an intuitive page layout. I worked on making sure that all of the features of the site worked properly and that they were as fast as possible. 
This is a good response. The candidate discusses their experience with web development and how they applied their skills to their internship at Cisco. They mention what their team focused on and also what their specific task was.

Q: What is your experience with performance optimization techniques in Web Development?
A: I worked on a team at the NCSA last summer that focused on improving the performance of our web application. We made sure to keep our code as modular as possible so that we could replace individual pieces if they became too slow. We used a profiler to track down where the bottleneck was in our system and modified our code to fix the problem.
This is a good response. The candidate mentions their experience with performance optimization techniques in their role on a team at NCSA last summer that focused on improving the performance of their web application. They show an understanding of performance optimization by mentioning their use of a profiler to locate problematic sections of the codebase. 

Q: Is there a mobile application that irritates you? How would you fix it?
A: I am generally happy with the applications that I create. However, there is one that I worked on last summer that I think could be improved. It was a client application that allowed teachers to access their student data from their school's portal. It had a pretty standard user interface and used a lot of HTML templates, but because I was less experienced with the design-side of application developemnt I found that the different templates made the application confusing to navigate. Looking back, spending time early to establish a coherent design would have been beneficial to have an easy-to-use app.
This is a good response. The candidate discusses their experience with a mobile application that they created and how they might have improved it. They discuss the candidate's experience and how they might have approached the design differently. This shows that the user has learned a lot about application development since they worked on this project. 

Q: As a project manager, how do you prioritize and manage tasks?
A: I prioritize my tasks based on what will have the greatest impact on the final result of the project. I try to find ways to combine different tasks into larger chunks of work that can be completed in a single session. If there is something that needs to be done but we don't have the time to do it right now, I will make sure to put it on the backlog so that we can tackle it later, potentially when we can pair it with a separate feature.
The candidate does well to discuss their approach to prioritizing and managing tasks as a project manager. Although, they could have provided some concrete examples of when they applied this methodology to specific tasks.

Q: As a software engineer, what was your most successful project? Why do you think was it successful?
A: I think my most successful project was my last summer working on Amazon's Alexa team. We built features for the assistant to make her more useful to customers. One of my tasks was to build a feature that allowed customers to view their past orders for easy re-ordering. We built a UI for the order details page in the app that displayed the order details and a section for adding new orders. We also revamped the voice-based order flow to make it easy for customers to place new orders without having to remember when and what they purchased.
This candidate does well to discuss their experiences on a team that found success. Their choice of the Alexa team was good, as the interviewer may be familiar with the product. They do not discuss why they believe their additions to the Alexa software were successful, though.
